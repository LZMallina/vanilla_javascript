//Instead of writing a giantic app for the site, I have decided to use modules to organize goals vs. income calculator

//import setGoal;

import setGoal from "./goalApp.js";

setGoal();

//import calculateIncome;

import calculateBudget from "./budgetApp.js";

calculateBudget();

import investment from "./investmentApp.js";
investment();
